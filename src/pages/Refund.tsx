    <p>At Nexora Digital, we want you to be completely satisfied with our services. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which refunds may be issued.</p>

    <h2>1. 7-Day Refund Window</h2>
    <p>We offer a 7-day refund window from the date of your initial subscription purchase. If you are not satisfied with our services within this period, you may request a full refund by contacting our support team.</p>

    <h2>2. Refund Eligibility Conditions</h2>
    <p>To be eligible for a refund, the following conditions must be met:</p>

      <li>You must provide the email address associated with your account</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Digital Service Access Terms</h2>
    <p>Since our products are digital services with immediate access upon purchase, refunds after the 7-day window are generally not available. This is because:</p>

      <li>API usage and computational resources are consumed upon access</li>
      <li>Generated content and data remain available to you during the subscription period</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Exceptions</h2>
    <p>We may consider refund requests outside the 7-day window in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service outage exceeding 72 consecutive hours</li>
      <li>Billing errors or unauthorized charges</li>
      <li>Significant feature changes that materially affect your use case</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Approved refunds are processed within 5–10 business days to your original payment method</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
